November 28th, 2013By Jill Tyburskisilently i sit in the corner staring atpink petals that behave like eyelids when the sun’slight strikes the orchid’s cells, arranged like bricks, a wall protecting its beating heartorchids don’t have heartsi realize with mascara jogging down my skinas pale as Grandma’s white sheets even thoughshe’s wearing clouds or wings it’s not angelic,it’s not beautiful. it’s thanksgiving they tell methe food is getting cold because the microwave’sdefibrillation of store bought mashed potatoes,cranberries, turkey only lasts for 100 beeps ofGrandma’s heart monitor so my aunt hands me plastic silverware and i envy my fork – no decomposition, no fear of soil or worms;plastic prongs free from the sickening smell of clean hospital waiting rooms in the cancer ward. i’m not hungry or thankful soi silently return to staring at the pink petals – delicate,feminine like aphrodite or ovaries andit occurs to me that this flower placed out of love on the windowsill will outlive the woman that it was for.
